# 321BTree

Discussion:
	Our B-Tree file works as described in the original assignment, It reads in the elements one at a time 
	into the B-Tree and works with the cache implemented. Our cache seems to speed up the testing of the 
	B-Tree considerably. This has varying effects based on cache-size. 
	Implementing the cache came at a cost however. It was fairly difficult to implement and likely took a lot 
	of focus away from ensuring that the rest of our code was working to a high standard. Given the time 
	frame and difficulty of this project,  it makes me wish we had managed our time slightly better.

Coulda-Shoulda-Woulda's:
	In a perfect world, we would have made progress on the project every day. However, this is fairly
unrealistic. It took us a week from when the assignment was given to start working. As we had already
arranged our group before we were told to sign up, we were able to make a decent head start on the assignment
and planning the skeleton of our code. As we were discussing B-Trees in class, we were copying down the
methods. Although it was a great start to the project, the progress wasn't sustainable. We quickly ran into
problems with the methods implemented early on conflicting with those methods added later. This could have
been prevented if we had implemented unit tests as we wrote the early code. As the due date loomed closer, we
started making consistent progress, but as the saying goes, it was a day late and a dollar short. While we
were still making great progress, we were not working fast enough and were encountering errors the whole
while. The past week, we started really hitting our stride. While we were still hitting errors, we got 
much faster at solving them.
